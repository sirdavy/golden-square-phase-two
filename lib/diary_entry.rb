# number of minutes the user has to read
# Returns a string with a chunk of the contents that the user could read
# in the given number of minutes.
# If called again, `reading_chunk` should return the next chunk, skipping
# what has already been read, until the contents is fully read.
# The next call after that it should restart from the beginning.
